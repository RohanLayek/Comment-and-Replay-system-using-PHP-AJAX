***************Comment and Replay system using Ajax, PHP.*****************************

This is a simple comment system. It looks good. I designed it using Bootstrap 3.3.7.
You have to do some changes..
1. Go to the comment.php file line no 29 and 30. Feed those veriable with your post id and user id.
2. Go to the includeit.php and feed with your DB details.
3. Now where you want to comment service.. Just include it there.
